# Artist Statement

## What my artwork is:

The name of my work is “Lonely lonely birthday party”. It’s a cake-making workstation. The main way of interaction is by using the variable mouseIsPressed [6] and the scope to control the movement of items. 

When users put their mouse on the tools, they will scale up to hint that they have picked them and they can interact with them. When users drag the glass of cream on the cake, it will tilt [5], hinting that users can drop the glass to pour the cream on, and the glass will be empty and go back. Users drag the piping bag to the cake. Once users loosen the mouse, it will drop the cream on the cake. Otherwise, the piping bag will automatically return to its original place. Users can press ENTER [7], and there will be a candle with a flickering fire.

The mouse should move slowly enough. 

## Why my work is an artwork:

My work motivates people to create their unique cakes with their ideas. Anyone alone on their birthday can make this virtual cake to celebrate it. The lovely colours contain happiness and sweetness. With the contrast of a sad, lonely birthday, it shows some special emotion.
